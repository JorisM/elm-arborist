{-| Various settings for the editor, defined at the time of [initialization](Arborist#initWith), or [added](Arborist#applySettings) at any time later in the program. Includes various geometric settings such as canvas dimensions and the gutter between nodes, and, in a later version of this package, more functional settings such as hiding placeholder nodes.

{-| When a node is activated, the interface centers it automatically. Sometimes, though, it is useful to move it somewhere other than the center, e.g. to accommodate a large pop-up underneath. With this configuration option, you can specify this offset, horizontal first, vertical second.

{-| Use this to specify SVG stroke attributes that will be applied for all paths linking nodes together, e.g:

    connectorStrokeAttributes [ strokeWidth "3", stroke "#EFEFEF", strokeLinecap "round" ]

Note the `Never` in the type signature: the compiler won't allow any event handlers with messages. Those are swallowed with an `Html.Attributes.map`.
