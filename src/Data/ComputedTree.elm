module Data.ComputedTree exposing (ComputedTree, tree, flat, layout, init, item)

{-| This module encapsulates computed information on a tree, information typically used for layout. When the tree is updated, there is a guarantee that this data is recalculated, avoiding expensive render-time recalculations or leaving it up to the developer to make sure the cache doesn't go stale.
